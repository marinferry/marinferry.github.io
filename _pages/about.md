I am an assistant professor (MCF) in economics at Université Gustave Eiffel and a member of the research unit ERUDITE. I am affiliated with the DIAL research team of the Université Paris Dauphine and the IRD. Since March 2024, I also worked as a consultant for the Banque de France (Service Afrique et Développement).
My research focuses on international and domestic financing, political economy, and environmental policies in the context of developing economies. I examine how financial and policy choices shape economic development, sustainability, and resilience in these regions.
